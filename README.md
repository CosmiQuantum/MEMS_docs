Hello and welcome to MEMS in LOUD.  This repository is intended to serve as a central (and sharable) location with READMEs and datasheets for the MEMS system.

[HM] Comment about structure of repo

## What is MEMS
[HM] ADD KELLYS BLOCK DIAGRAM MEMS PIC, THEN WRITE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MEMS IS

**Onboarding resources:**
* [Kelly's description of the MEMS program, pre-installation in LOUD (8/2022)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EdDBv1uNEWqCI73cme1L7-Cg87s-V7iwivkqoPncXTw/edit#slide=id.p)
* [Folder with presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UWY2XsLM5ypoSD7gy8bRqhrUESGADwUB)
* Talks available on youtube:
  * *Note that these are both horribly out of date, and do not include results of cold testing. Nevertheless, they may be helpful for students trying to familiarize themselves with the MEMS system & its big-picture goals*
  * [Kelly Stifter, Snowmass 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy0oarMECdM) (awarded best poster!)
  * [Kelly Stifter, QSC summer school 2022](https://youtu.be/VW6oRTCWZw8?t=2815)
