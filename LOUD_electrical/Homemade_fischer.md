# Homemade cable setup
Two cables are used to route the MEMS driver 10pin output to pins on the ficher fridge port:

# Cable \#1: Fischer to MDM
This was designed to be a multi-purpose ribbon cable.  All 24 pins on the fischer cable were soldered to the MDM.  The pinout convention was designed to follow that of the 5m commercial Fischer to MDM cables purchased for LOUD.  Pin \#13 of the MDM is left floating (note that in the commercial fischer cables, pin 13 is wired to the twisted pair shielding).

### MDM pinouts
The drawing below is used to define an MDM pin numbering scheme.  Annotations with MEMS-specific pinouts are included to help with multimeter testing, but note that this cable was not designed specifically for MEMS.  It was instead designed to match the pinouts of the commercially bought shielded Fischer cables.

### Fischer pinouts
The following drawing shows the MDM pin numbers mapped to pins on the ficher end of the connector. Once again, annotations with MEMS pinouts are included.
