noteL: mapping this out as motivation to do it later

# Optical Map Through LOUD

google drawing cartoon overview


## Step One: AWG Control
minimum pulse length of awg

minimum ramp up/down times of the awg

## Step Two: Laser Diode
pic of laser datasheet calibration curve

comment about operating in flat current regime

## Step Three: Filter bank
optional, list some of the filters for reference

## Step Four: Cabling through fridge
yeah this is a tossup

## Step Five: Coupling to Focuser 
biggest (known) attenuation factor

100um core down to 10um core

## Step Six: Focuser and in-box attenuation
also a tossup

## Step Seven: IR filter at output
find datasheet and calibration curve

## Step Eight: Surface of the device
this is a ryan problem i think.
