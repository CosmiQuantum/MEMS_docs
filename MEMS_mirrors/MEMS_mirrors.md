# MEMS Mirrors FAQ
I'm starting a document to serve as a reference for students starting to with MEMS mirrors at FNAL.

HANNAH COMMENT ABOUT PROS AND CONS OF LARGE VS SMALL MIRRORS

Note that the 4.6mm mirror shown above has a layer of kapton tape over its face.  The mirrors were all delivered with this tape.  
The tape is not touching the face of the mirror; it is separated by a small piece of glass.  Before installing a mirror, this tape must be removed with tweezers 
(ideally plastic tweezers for ESD reasons).

A serial number is printed on the back of each mirror pcb.  Mirror locations have historically been
tracked in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SfAJXwR_5d47hqugquiN4ruBxzNecHy8UDuXBtk5U1g/edit#gid=0).  

**For ease of access, notable serial numbers are included below:**
| Serial Number | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| S50500 | LOUD silicon chip |
| S50499 | Lab A --> at Kelly's desk in a copper mount (reserved for QUIET) |

Mirror are stored in boxes, 
which are kept in ESD bubble wrap bags.  Each box holds two mirrors:

Sharpie labels on the top of each box indicate the serial numbers of the mirrors inside.  The left mirror is listed first, and the right mirror is listed second.
If you ever lose track of which mirror is which, check the serial number on the back/bottom.

### Reading mirror datasheets
Mirrors are individually calibrated with bias voltage recommendations.  These are found in the mirror datasheets, which can be found at
[FNAL_mirror_datasheets.zip](https://github.com/CosmiQuantum/MEMS_docs/blob/main/MEMS_mirrors/FNAL_mirror_datasheets.zip).  

A sample datasheet is included below.  I've highlighted the relevant parameters.
